@book{Dea.2014,
 abstract = {JavaFX 8: Introduction by Example shows you how to use your existing Java skills to create graphically exciting client applications with the JavaFX 8 platform. The book is a new and much improved edition of JavaFX 2.0: Introduction by Example, taking you through a series of engaging, fun-to-work examples that bring you up to speed on the major facets of the platform. It will help you to create applications that look good, are fun to use, and that take advantage of the medium to present data of all types in ways that engage the user and lead to increased productivity. Entirely example-based, JavaFX 8: Introduction by Example begins with the fundamentals of installing the software and creating a simple interface. From there, you'll move in progressive steps through the process of developing applications using JavaFX's standard drawing primitives. You'll then explore images, animations, media, and web. This new edition incorporates the changes resulting from the switch to Java 8 SDK. It covers advanced topics such as FXML, charting, custom controls, JavaFX 3D, gesture devices, and embedded systems. Best of all, the book is full of working code that you can adapt and extend to all your future projects. Entirely example-based Filled with fun and practical code examples Covers all that's new in Java 8 relating to JavaFX such as Lambda expressions and Streams Covers gesture devices, 3D display, embedded systems, and other advanced topics.},

 abstract = {Pro JPA 2, Second Edition introduces, explains, and demonstrates how to use the new Java Persistence API (JPA) 2.1 from the perspective of one of the specification creators. A one-of-a-kind resource, it provides both theoretical and extremely practical coverage of JPA usage for both beginning and advanced developers. Authors Mike Keith and Merrick Schincariol take a hands-on approach, based on their wealth of experience and expertise, by giving examples to illustrate each concept of the API and showing how it is used in practice. The examples use a common model from an overriding sample application, giving readers a context from which to start and helping them to understand the examples within an already familiar domain. After completing the book, you will have a full understanding of JPA and be able to successfully code applications using its annotations and APIs. The book also serves as an excellent reference guide during initial and later JPA application experiences.},

@www{Melbourne.2014,
 abstract = {One of the challenges of running usability testing on mobile devices is how to record a video of the session. Recording sessions on desktops is easy. Applications like Morae or Silverback have been allowing us to do screen captures with a picture-in-picture window of a participant’s face
of full picture of what the user is doing.
On mobile devices it's not
so easy. On mobile devices
users hand/fingers are doing as the targets they are tap on. When you combine this with the movement of handheld devices recording a usability testing session becomes somewhat more complicated.
On a recent project, we ran 10 participants through a competitor comparison of apps. To record these sessions we put together a somewhat ad-hoc, yet highly effective recording setup that used
a camera
we made it work, including:
Choosing a video recording approach The pop-up usability lab
The camera mount - Mr Tappy The cameras
Recording software
Remote broadcasting of the sessions Lighting
What would we change next time?},
